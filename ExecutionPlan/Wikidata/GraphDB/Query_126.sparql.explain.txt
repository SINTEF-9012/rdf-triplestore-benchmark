# NOTE: Optimization groups are evaluated one after another exactly in the given order.
# If there are too many optimization groups consisting of a single statement pattern,
# then one should try to relocate the following clauses by hand:
# VALUES, BIND, OPTIONAL, property paths with '*' and/or '+' (the latter can be also surrounded with brackets).
# Sub-SELECTs will always be evaluated first."
